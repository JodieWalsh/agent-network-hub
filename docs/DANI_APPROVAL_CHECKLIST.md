### 15. Professional Accreditation Verification
**Location:** User profile setup, admin approval workflow

### 16. Disclaimer & Fee Messaging
**Location:** Throughout inspection marketplace

**Context:** We've added transparent fee breakdowns and professional disclaimers throughout the inspection workflow:

| Location | What's Shown |
|----------|--------------|
| Post Job (Budget step) | Live fee breakdown as poster enters budget |
| Job Detail (for inspectors) | "Your Earnings" card showing 90% take-home |
| Express Interest modal | Live earnings calculation as inspector bids |
| Viewing Bids | Fee breakdown for each bid |
| Accept Bid dialog | Full payment breakdown with confirmation |
| My Work (accepted jobs) | Earnings display (after platform fee) |
| Report Builder (start) | "Before You Begin" disclaimer about peer inspection |
| Report Builder (submit) | Required checkbox confirming professional opinion disclaimer |
| Report View (top) | "Peer Inspection Report" disclaimer banner |
| Approve Report dialog | Payment breakdown with professional recommendation |

**Sample Disclaimer Text:**
> "This report reflects [Inspector Name]'s professional opinion based on a visual walkthrough. This is a peer-to-peer service between buyers agents – it is not a substitute for certified building, pest, or structural inspections."

**Sample Fee Breakdown:**
```
Budget you're offering: $200.00
├── Inspector receives (90%): $180.00
└── Platform fee (10%): $20.00
```

**Questions for Dani:**

- [ ] Do we need a lawyer to review these disclaimers before launch?
- [ ] Should there be a separate "Inspection Marketplace Terms" page?

---

### 17. Escrow Payment Workflow
**Location:** Throughout inspection marketplace

**Context:** We've implemented an escrow-based payment system where job posters pay upfront and funds are held securely until the report is approved.

**Payment Flow:**
| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Post Job | Job poster pays full amount upfront → Payment secured in escrow |
| 2. Bid Accepted | Funds already secured → Inspector has confidence to proceed |
| 3. Report Submitted | Inspector submits report → Poster reviews |
| 4. Report Approved | Poster approves → Payment RELEASED to inspector |

**Refund Scenarios:**
| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Job cancelled before bid accepted | Full refund to poster |
| Job expires with no bids | Full refund to poster |
| Job expires after bid accepted | Case-by-case review |

**UI Elements Added:**
- **Post Job (Payment step):** New step 4 with mock payment flow + escrow explanation
- **Job Cards & Details:** "Payment Secured" badge for funded jobs
- **Express Interest modal:** Shows "Payment is already secured in escrow"
- **Accept Bid dialog:** Updated to show "Payment will be released from escrow"
- **Cancel Job dialog:** Shows "Refund Eligible" message for open jobs
- **Approve Report dialog:** Button says "Approve & Release" instead of "Approve & Pay"

**Questions for Dani:**
- [ ] Is the 3-step escrow explanation clear for users?
- [ ] Are the refund policies reasonable?
- [ ] Should we add a "How Payments Work" standalone help page?
- [ ] Review the mock payment button wording - OK until Stripe is integrated?
- [ ] What happens if a dispute arises after bid is accepted but before report is submitted?
- [ ] Should there be a time limit for disputes after report approval?
- [ ] Legal review needed for escrow terms?

**Technical Notes:**
- payment_status field added to inspection_jobs table: pending → paid → released | refunded
- Actual Stripe integration will come later (currently mock payment flow)
- Notifications updated for payment events

### 18. Stripe & Business Setup
**Location:** Payment processing

**Context:** Stripe integration has been set up for:
1. **Subscriptions** - Monthly/annual plans for premium features
2. **Marketplace Payments** - Paying inspectors via Stripe Connect (90% to inspector, 10% platform)
3. **Automatic Invoices** - For tax purposes
4. **Future:** Course payments

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Stripe packages installed (@stripe/stripe-js, stripe)
- ✅ Frontend Stripe client configured (src/lib/stripe.ts)
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions created for all Stripe operations
- ✅ Database fields added for subscriptions and Connect accounts
- ⏳ Awaiting Stripe account credentials and subscription pricing decisions

**Questions for Dani - Business Setup:**
- [ ] Create new Stripe account for "Buyers Agent Hub"? (Recommended - separate from Jodie's other app)
- [ ] Business structure: ABN? Pty Ltd? Partnership?
- [ ] Business bank account for receiving platform fees?
- [ ] Who is the "responsible person" for Stripe verification?
- [ ] Business address for invoices?
- [ ] GST registered? (Affects invoice formatting - 10% GST on platform fees)

**Questions for Dani - Subscription Tiers:**

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | What's Included? |
|------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Free | $0 | $0 | ??? (needs definition) |
| Basic | $29? | $290? | ??? (needs definition) |
| Premium | $79? | $790? | ??? (needs definition) |

- [ ] Confirm subscription pricing above
- [ ] What features are included in each tier?
- [ ] Free trial period? (7, 14, or 30 days?)
- [ ] Founding member discount? (e.g., 50% off first year)
- [ ] Annual discount percentage? (currently ~17%)

**Questions for Dani - Stripe Connect (Inspector Payouts):**
- [ ] Confirm 90/10 split (inspector gets 90%, platform keeps 10%)
- [ ] Minimum payout threshold? (e.g., $50 before payout)
- [ ] Payout frequency? (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] What happens if inspector hasn't completed Stripe onboarding?

**Technical Notes:**
- Edge Functions deployed to: `supabase/functions/stripe-*`
- Webhook endpoint: `https://[project].supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
- Test mode: Use `pk_test_xxx` and `sk_test_xxx` keys
- Live mode: Switch to `pk_live_xxx` and `sk_live_xxx` only in production

---

### 19. Subscription Upgrade Redirect Behaviour
**Location:** Pricing page → Stripe Checkout → Post-checkout redirect

**Context:** When a current subscriber upgrades their subscription (e.g., Basic → Premium), they are redirected to the `/welcome` onboarding page after checkout completes. This may be confusing for existing users who have already completed onboarding.

**Question for Dani:**
- [ ] When a current subscriber upgrades, should they be redirected to `/welcome`? Or should they go back to their dashboard / billing page instead?
- [ ] Should the `/welcome` page only appear for brand-new signups?

---

### 20. Stripe Fees Eating Into Platform Fee
**Location:** Platform-wide payment economics

**Context:** We charge a 10% platform fee on inspection jobs, but Stripe takes approximately 2.9% + 30c per transaction from the gross amount. This significantly reduces actual platform revenue, especially on smaller jobs.

**Example on a $200 job:**
| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Job total | $200.00 |
| Platform fee (10%) | $20.00 |
| Stripe processing (~2.9% + 30c) | ~$6.10 |
| **Actual platform revenue** | **~$13.90** |
| Stripe's share of our fee | **~30%** |

**Impact by job size:**
| Job Size | Platform Fee (10%) | Stripe Fee (~3%) | Actual Revenue | Stripe % of Fee |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| $100 | $10 | ~$3.20 | ~$6.80 | ~32% |
| $200 | $20 | ~$6.10 | ~$13.90 | ~30% |
| $500 | $50 | ~$14.80 | ~$35.20 | ~30% |
| $1,000 | $100 | ~$29.30 | ~$70.70 | ~29% |

**Questions for Dani:**
- [ ] Is 10% still the right platform fee, or should we increase it (e.g., 12-15%)?
- [ ] Should we pass Stripe processing fees on to the customer (charge 10% + payment processing)?
- [ ] Should we absorb Stripe fees as a cost of doing business?
- [ ] For smaller jobs the impact is worse — should there be a minimum platform fee (e.g., $10)?

**Note:** This doesn't need immediate action but should be reviewed before launch.
