==============================================================================

I'm working on Agent Hub, a B2B SaaS platform for real estate professionals.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Platform: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL with PostGIS, Storage, Auth)
- Location: Mapbox Geocoding API
- Current branch: main
- Dev server: http://localhost:8087

RECENT WORK (January 11, 2026):
We just fixed three critical bugs:
1. Added Admin Property Review Modal - admins can now view full property details before approving/rejecting
2. Fixed missing street numbers in addresses - Mapbox geocoder now combines house number + street name
3. Fixed price storage and validation - upgraded to BIGINT, added validation, prevented corruption

KEY PROJECT FILES:
- Plan file: C:\Users\Jodie Ralph\.claude\plans\drifting-whistling-matsumoto.md
- Session summary: SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-01-11.md
- Database migrations: supabase/migrations/*.sql
- Environment: .env (Supabase + Mapbox credentials configured)

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Properties require admin approval before appearing in marketplace
- User roles: admin, verified_professional, pending_professional, guest
- File uploads go to Supabase Storage (property-images, floor-plans buckets)
- Currency auto-detects from property country (UK→GBP, US→USD, AU→AUD)
- Addresses use single smart search field (like Zillow/Airbnb)
