# Session: July 7, 2026 — 🎉 INTERVIEW FUNNEL COMPLETE (pieces 4 & 5)
**Session Focus:** the final two Interview Funnel pieces — clean dashboard separation of the two populations, and the personalised intro-email drafting helper — closing out the whole funnel.

## 🎯 Session Summary
**The Interview Funnel (pieces 1–5) is now COMPLETE.** The command centre tells the truth about two populations (waitlist metrics no longer polluted by outreach contacts, plus a dedicated interview-funnel widget), and drafting the personalised intro email — step 1 of the funnel — is now a one-command Claude Code skill fed by Jodie's hand research.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`53ec90b` — piece 4, dashboard separation + widget**: the dashboard's waitlist funnel metrics are now scoped to **waitlist contacts only** (outreach contacts no longer distort them), and a small **interview-funnel widget** shows outreach contacts per interview stage.
- **`e8d261a` — piece 5, the skill-first approach**: a **`.claude/skills/draft-intro-email/SKILL.md`** Claude Code skill that drafts on-brand personalised intro emails from research notes about one agent — Brand Kit voice; Jodie polishes and sends herself, one at a time, never bulk. **Decision: we chose the skill over an in-app composer** (no API key, no new UI; the draft happens where the research happens). **Claude-in-Chrome can gather the research per agent** before invoking the skill. An in-app AI composer remains a future option (would need an Anthropic API key setup).
- 🎉 **The whole Interview Funnel (pieces 1–5) is complete** — label, compliance wall, stage pipeline, dashboard separation + widget, and the intro-email drafting skill.

## ⏭️ Next
- **TODO**: an "Outreach" Mailchimp tag when a consented outreach contact is pushed.
- Standing queue: wipe demo data after Dani reviews; questionnaire; Resend welcome email (**✅ unblocked** — `buyersagenthub.com` confirmed verified in the Resend dashboard; the app sends from `hello@buyersagenthub.com`; older "domain verification first" notes below are stale); Dani #24; mobile/large-font accessibility review; full app audit.
- **Parked (legal/Dani conversation)**: any auto-harvesting of agents' emails/phones — deliberately not built.

# Session: July 6/7, 2026 — Region UI + INTERVIEW FUNNEL pieces 1–3
**Session Focus:** the launch-region UI landed on Geneva's list + dashboard, and the Interview Funnel — Geneva's high-touch outreach machine for treasured buyers agents — went from idea to a working 3-piece pipeline.

## 🎯 Session Summary
Geneva now holds **two populations with different compliance rules**, cleanly separated: **waitlist** (opted in themselves — completely unaffected by everything below, verified pixel-identical) and **interview_outreach** (we reached out — walled off from Mailchimp until explicit consent is RECORDED on the tamper-resistant timeline). Outreach contacts travel a 7-step interview journey with gentle, never-automatic task nudges.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`a285a0b` — launch-region UI**: deep-rose **Region filter chips** on the contacts list (live counts, combines with saved views, `?region=` deep-links, calm empty state + Clear filters) and the **Demand-by-Region widget** on the command centre (bars sorted highest-first, counts DB-verified, "No region set: N" line, bars click through to the filtered list). *Demo-data note:* the 24 demo contacts were enriched with city-consistent `launch_regions` (field-level only, 21 with regions / 3 deliberately without; count stayed 24; seed script updated to match) — approved by Jodie as making Dani's demo better.
- **`3a2ea21` — Interview Funnel piece 1, the label**: `contact_type` `'waitlist' | 'interview_outreach'` (NOT NULL DEFAULT 'waitlist', CHECK; all existing rows auto-backfilled waitlist; public intake untouched — form signups default waitlist by DB default).
- **`024cb6b` — piece 2, surfacing + the compliance wall**: champagne **"Outreach" chip** on record + list rows; **Contact Type picker** on the form with a gentle not-opted-in note; **Type filter** (appears only when outreach contacts exist). **The wall:** marking an outreach contact `subscribed` REQUIRES a "how was consent obtained" note → written as a `consent_changed` activity (`evidence`, `explicit: true`) on the **append-only** timeline (no UPDATE/DELETE policies = tamper-resistant Spam-Act paper trail); `geneva-mailchimp-push` refuses `interview_outreach` without that entry (409 `consent_not_recorded`) — a bare dropdown flip cannot push. Waitlist push behaviour unchanged (verified).
- **`42582c6` — piece 3, the pipeline**: `interview_stage` (11-token CHECK; migration `20260707020000`) — `to_contact → intro_email_sent → call_made → interview_booked → questions_sent → reminder_sent → interviewed → thanked → clips_sent` + exits `declined` / `declined_kept_on_list`. Outreach records **lead with the numbered interview badge** (lifecycle badge hidden for them only), frosted "Interview Journey" picker (numbered steps + "If they said no" section), every move timeline-logged with days-in-stage, and **dismissible advisory task suggestions** at the four natural moments (booked→questions, questions→reminder, interviewed→thank-you, thanked→clips) — "Add task" pre-fills the normal dialog, the admin always clicks Create. `declined_kept_on_list` shows the consent-wall reminder. List Stage column shows the interview badge for outreach rows; the form starts outreach contacts at `to_contact`.
- All verified end-to-end against live data with zero WCAG contrast issues, non-admins blocked, and **every geneva_* count restored exactly after each run** (24/6/7/55).

## ⏭️ Next
- **Interview Funnel piece 4**: keep outreach OUT of the dashboard's waitlist funnel metrics + a small interview-funnel widget. **Piece 5**: personalised-email drafting helper. **TODO**: an "Outreach" Mailchimp tag when a consented outreach contact is pushed.
- **Parked (legal/Dani conversation)**: any auto-harvesting of agents' emails/phones — deliberately not built.
- Standing queue: wipe demo data after Dani reviews; questionnaire; Resend welcome email (domain verification first); Dani #24; mobile/large-font accessibility review; full app audit.

# Session: July 6, 2026 — Launch-region capture + Mailchimp region targeting (complete end-to-end)
**Session Focus:** the region-targeted launch pipeline — from a waitlist tap to a one-region launch email.

## 🎯 Session Summary
We can now answer "who works where?" from the moment a lead arrives, and email **exactly one launch region** from Mailchimp. The full workflow, every link verified: **waitlist region pick → Geneva contact (tokens stored + shown on the record) → subscribed-only push → Mailchimp `Region: …` tag → region-targeted launch email.**

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`9ee4fb4` — Stage 1: launch-region capture on the waitlist.** A 7-option **controlled vocabulary** (`greater_sydney`, `greater_melbourne`, `seq`, `greater_perth`, `uk`, `us`, `other` — labels once in `src/lib/geneva.ts` `LAUNCH_REGION_LABELS`) as a warm optional chip multi-select ("Where do you work?"). Enforced in **three layers**: form chips (only valid tokens exist) → `geneva-lead-intake` whitelist/dedupe/cap-at-7 (a 13-item attack array reduced to exactly the 7 valid tokens in testing) → `geneva_contacts.launch_regions` DB CHECK via `<@` (unknown token rejected even at service level; migration `20260706020000`). **Accessible:** chips wrap cleanly at 375px AND at a large-font simulation (24px root — verified programmatically per-chip, no overflow). Regions display as MapPin chips on the Geneva contact record.
- **`58b2797` — Piece 2: Mailchimp region tags.** `geneva-mailchimp-push` now also sends one **`Region: <short name>`** tag per captured region (e.g. `Region: Greater Sydney`) alongside "Geneva CRM" + the professional-type tag; the exact tag set is recorded in the `pushed_to_mailchimp` timeline entry. Short prefixed names chosen so region tags group together and segment cleanly in Mailchimp. Contacts without regions push with base tags only; the subscribed-only rule unchanged. **Verified into the real audience by Jodie** (saw the tags, deleted the test members). *Mailchimp recipe: segment where Tag = "Region: Greater Sydney" → launch email to one region.*
- Honest test note: one verify scenario initially "failed" because **Mailchimp itself rejects `@example.com` addresses as fake** — external validation, not a bug; it usefully proved the error path (status recorded, clean admin diagnostics). Re-run with a deliverable address: clean pass. Demo data untouched throughout (24 contacts before and after every run).

## ⏭️ Queued / parked
- Small pieces: Geneva contacts-list **"filter by launch region"** chip + **"Demand by region"** command-centre widget.
- **Stage 2 (waitlist regions → profile service areas)** stays deliberately parked with the **Work Regions** decision (`docs/WORK_REGIONS_SPEC.md`) — build the regions plumbing once.
- Standing: wipe demo data after Dani reviews; questionnaire; Resend welcome email (domain verification first); Dani #24; mobile/large-font accessibility review.

# Session: July 5/6, 2026 — FINAL: 🎉 GENEVA v1 COMPLETE (all 4 phases)
**Session Focus:** Phase 4 shipped — the growth command centre — closing out Geneva v1 three days after the first line of its roadmap.

## 🎯 Session Summary
Geneva is done: capture (landing waitlist → secure intake), manage (contacts list + record with notes/tasks/timeline), nurture (subscribed-only Mailchimp push), and now **steer** — a command-centre dashboard at `/geneva` that answers the founder's questions at a glance: how's the funnel, where do leads get stuck, which channels bring quality, who needs follow-up today, are we growing.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`f266e4e` — Phase 4: the command centre** (`GenevaDashboard.tsx` + saved-view chips in `GenevaContacts.tsx`; sidebar/`/geneva` routing):
  - **The lifecycle funnel** — tapering bars on cumulative "reach", per-stage "here now" counts, stage-to-stage advance %, and a gentle champagne chip auto-marking the **biggest drop-off** transition. Inactive contacts shown separately below the flow.
  - **Headline metric cards** (Total / Subscribed / New this week / Needs follow-up / Active customers) — each **deep-links** to the pre-filtered contacts list via `?view=`.
  - **Growth signal** — new-contacts-per-week bars over 4 weeks with an up/down line (pure CSS, no chart lib).
  - **Channel performance** — two-tone bars per source: forest = reached **qualified+**, champagne = earlier; sorted by quality first, so the best channels (not just loudest) rise.
  - **By professional type** breakdown; **"Needs attention today"** action list (most-overdue tasks first, rows link to the contact record).
  - **Saved-view chips** on the contacts list: All / New this week / Needs follow-up / Subscribed / Pending consent / Prospects / Nurturing / Active customers / Inactive — live counts, deep-linkable, calm per-view ✦ empty states.
  - Loading skeletons + a lovely ✦ zero-data state ("Your command centre awaits") — previewable via `?empty=1` without touching data. Verified against live demo data with all numbers cross-checked to the DB; zero contrast issues; non-admins blocked from `/geneva` and `/geneva/contacts`.
- **`46db760` — demo seed/wipe script** (`geneva-demo-data.mjs`: seed/status/wipe): ⚠️ **24 demo contacts are CURRENTLY SEEDED for Dani's review** (all emails `@geneva-demo.example`; never push them to Mailchimp). **Wipe after she reviews:** `node geneva-demo-data.mjs wipe` — deletes only the demo domain; real waitlist leads are never touched. Then remove the ⚠️ note from `docs/GENEVA_ROADMAP.md`.
- **`c3299f4` — brand tone fix:** payment-released notification retitled **"Paid and on its way"** (the earlier, cheekier title was retired as off-brand); all references updated repo-wide.
- **`a4d402a` — Brand Kit** (`docs/BRAND_KIT.md`): the single brand reference — palette with WCAG-verified contrast rules, Cormorant/DM Sans rules, voice & tone with the playful-signature policy, UI signatures, Do/Don't. Linked from README.

## ⏭️ Next
- **Wipe demo data after Dani reviews** (command above).
- Backlog: questionnaire (lead-capture piece 3), Resend welcome email (needs buyersagenthub.com domain verification), Dani #24 landing-messaging decisions, mobile/large-font accessibility review.

# Session: July 5/6, 2026 — Geneva Phase 3: Mailchimp push
**Session Focus:** Geneva Phase 3 COMPLETE (`c69406d`) — the one-way Mailchimp push. **The full growth pipeline now works end-to-end: landing waitlist form → Geneva contact → explicit admin button → Mailchimp audience → nurture sequence.**

## 🎯 Session Summary
Subscribed-only contacts can now be pushed to Mailchimp audience `606099323d` by an **explicit admin button** on the Geneva contact record — never automatically. The firm rule is enforced server-side twice: the `geneva-mailchimp-push` edge function (deployed WITH JWT verification) re-checks that the caller is an admin (`profiles.role`) AND that the contact is `email_consent_status='subscribed'` before any Mailchimp call; pending/unsubscribed/bounced/complained are politely refused (409). Verified end-to-end — **Jodie confirmed the test contact arrived in Mailchimp with all merge fields + tags, then deleted it.**

## ✅ Accomplished (commit `c69406d`)
- **Migration `20260706010000`**: `mailchimp_status` ('synced'/'error'/null) + `mailchimp_synced_at` on `geneva_contacts` (applied via Management API).
- **`geneva-mailchimp-push` edge function**: upsert by `md5(lower(email))` (idempotent — double-push proven safe); merge fields `FNAME/LNAME/PTYPE/REGION/SOURCE` + tags **"Geneva CRM"** and the professional-type label; `status_if_new` only (never force-resubscribes someone who unsubscribed in Mailchimp); records sync status + writes a `pushed_to_mailchimp` timeline entry; API key only ever read from the `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` secret, never logged/returned. Admin-only error responses include Mailchimp's error title for debuggability.
- **UI**: "Push to Mailchimp" button on the contact record (disabled + quiet note unless subscribed), discreet "In Mailchimp · date" chip near the consent dot, `pushToMailchimp()` helper in `src/lib/geneva.ts`.
- **Verification**: no-auth 401, non-admin 403, pending 409 (contact untouched), subscribed push via real UI ✓ (status+timestamp+activity+chip), idempotent second push ✓, zero contrast issues, geneva tables left at 0 rows.
- **⚠️ Ops lesson worth remembering**: the first push failed with Mailchimp "API key linked to a different datacenter" — root cause was a **trailing newline pasted into the Supabase secret**. Fix (permanent): the function **derives the datacenter from the API key's own `-usXX` suffix** and **trims all secret values**. If a future secret misbehaves, check for whitespace first.

## ⏭️ Remaining
- **Geneva Phase 4** (last v1 piece): saved views/segments + the command-centre dashboard.
- Backlog (docs/IDEAS_BACKLOG.md): **brand kit (marked next)**, questionnaire, Resend welcome email (needs buyersagenthub.com domain verification), waitlist regions, property overlays, Dani #24 landing messaging.

# Session: July 5, 2026 (Geneva + landing capture session — part 2)
**Session Focus:** The public lead pipeline went LIVE end-to-end — secure intake → landing waitlist form → Geneva — plus a consumer-law honesty pass on the landing page.

## 🎯 Session Summary
After the Geneva contact record page (part 1), the Landing-Page Lead Capture phase began and shipped its first two pieces. A public visitor can now join the waitlist on the landing page and arrive in Geneva as a contact — attributed to their source, consent handled lawfully — without Geneva's admin-only walls moving an inch. The landing page also had every fabricated pre-launch claim removed.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`8feef7a` — secure public lead-intake edge function** (`geneva-lead-intake`, deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`; + migration `20260705030000` making `created_by` nullable — NULL renders as "Landing page" on the timeline): write-only by construction (returns ONLY `{ ok: true }`), honeypot field, origin allow-list, strict validation/length caps, **forced-safe server-side defaults** (stage `new`, no owner; smuggled fields proven blocked), **consent `subscribed` ONLY on explicit opt-in**, UTM → `original_source` mapping, **silent-duplicate handling** (no email enumeration; repeat signups append a `source_captured` activity to the existing contact). **Geneva RLS untouched** — anon verified reading zero rows and blocked from direct inserts. Deferred by decision: per-IP rate limiting + captcha (v1 = honeypot + validation, recorded in the roadmap).
- **`66af5da` — public waitlist capture form** on the landing page ("Founding Cohort / Be First Through the Door" section, between testimonials-spot and pricing): first/last name, email, all six professional types (Buyers Agent default), region/company, explicit consent checkbox, hidden honeypot, **UTM passthrough from the landing URL**; POSTs only to the edge function; elegant "You're on the list ✦" success state. Verified live end-to-end: consented signup → `subscribed` + `contact_created` (source `landing_page`, UTM captured); no-consent → `pending`; bad email → gentle inline error, nothing sent.
- **`1903d67` — waitlist CTAs + landing honesty pass**: deep-rose **JOIN WAITLIST** header pill, hero "Not ready for an account yet?" line, mobile-menu CTA — all anchoring to the form. **Honesty pass (consumer-law risk removed):** fabricated stats bar ("500+ / 2,400+ / 4.9★") → truthful launch bar (Launching Soon · One Place · Vetted · Protected); the three invented testimonials → the **Founding Cohort** section (real benefits, no fake names/quotes); "500+ agents already…" final CTA → honest founding-access copy. All NEW copy global-friendly (US/UK expansion) — remaining AU-specific spots flagged, not touched.
- **Dani checklist:** item **#23** (CRM/Monaco subscription gating — pre-existing, still open) and new item **#24 — pre-launch landing messaging**: the four remaining AU-specific spots (hero eyebrow, marketplace card, overlays copy, footer), the JOIN FREE→waitlist decision, the pricing reframe ("founding-member pricing" vs buy-now + trial claim), and whether app pages stay publicly browsable pre-launch.

## ⏭️ Next
- Ideas backlog captured in `docs/IDEAS_BACKLOG.md` (brand kit next, waitlist regions, welcome email, Mailchimp push details now gathered, questionnaire, property overlays, the Dani #24 messaging pass).
- Geneva v1 still to finish: **Phase 3 Mailchimp push** (account details now known — see backlog) and **Phase 4 dashboard/segments**.

# Session: July 5, 2026 (Geneva session)
**Session Focus:** GENEVA begun and moving fast — plan + Phase 1 + Phase 2 of BAH's internal admin-only CRM all shipped in one day.

## 🎯 Session Summary
**Geneva** is Buyers Agent Hub's OWN internal CRM — Jodie & Dani's growth command-centre for capturing and nurturing buyers agents (and other pros) as BAH's customers, especially pre-launch. It is **separate from Monaco** (the buyers-agent-facing CRM, 100% complete): own fresh `geneva_*` tables, and the OPPOSITE access model — **admin-only with a SHARED team view** (RLS via `public.is_admin()`; any admin sees/edits everything; regular users get nothing — proven with a real non-admin test user, twice).

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **Geneva plan** — `docs/GENEVA_ROADMAP.md` (commits `228a642`, `6da7399`): v1 scope + locked decisions. Key rules: **six professional types** (buyers_agent default, real_estate_agent, conveyancer, mortgage_broker, building_and_pest_inspector, stylist); **one-way Mailchimp only, and ONLY `subscribed` contacts are ever pushed** (AU Spam Act — firm rule, enforced in code at Phase 3); email = dedup key (case-insensitive unique index); timeline instead of a heavy audit log; "inactive requires a reason". Also recorded the expanded **landing-page lead-capture future phase** (public capture form via SECURITY DEFINER RPC/edge function + short qualifying questionnaire + UTM/source attribution + Resend welcome email — one cohesive feature, early post-v1 candidate).
- **`8e8b891` — Phase 1 tables** (migration `20260705010000`, applied via Management API + verified): `geneva_contacts` / `geneva_notes` / `geneva_tasks` / `geneva_activities` with admin-only RLS on every table, activities **append-only** (no UPDATE/DELETE policies), 7 CHECK constraints, case-insensitive unique email index (proven blocking at insert), updated_at triggers. Monaco tables untouched.
- **`f718c4a` — Phase 1 UI**: Geneva contacts list at `/geneva/contacts` + add/edit form (`src/pages/geneva/`, shared `src/lib/geneva.ts`), admin-only routes (`requiredRole="admin"` — NOT Monaco's brief permission), "Geneva" sidebar item in the admin-only block. Duplicate email → friendly inline message (409 caught). `contact_created` timeline entry on create.
- **`9cabd76` — Phase 2 contact record** at `/geneva/contacts/:id`: top summary panel (click-to-email/call, owner/source/dates meta card) + **Overview / Notes / Tasks / Timeline** tabs. Notes with edit/delete-own (frosted confirm). Tasks with owner/due/priority, complete + reschedule, **gentle champagne overdue chips**. Stage changes from the record — **Inactive requires a reason in the same dialog** (save disabled until chosen; reason → `inactive_reason` + timeline context). Timeline renders friendly prose. List rows now open the record (Edit lives on the record).
- **`3059d87` — Dani-approved rename**: profession type → **"Building and Pest Inspector"** (`building_and_pest_inspector`) — token renamed via migration `20260705020000` while the table was empty; old token proven rejected, new accepted; label map drives form/badges everywhere.
- All verified end-to-end with real data (`geneva-verify.mjs`, `geneva-record-verify.mjs`): zero WCAG contrast issues across 21 audits, desktop + 375px mobile, tsc clean, and **all four geneva_* tables left at 0 rows** after every run.

## ⏭️ Remaining Geneva v1
- **Phase 3 — one-way Mailchimp push**: needs the Mailchimp **API key** (edge-function secret) + **audience ID**, and confirm the push style (Jodie leans explicit **"Push to Mailchimp" button**, not automatic). Only `subscribed` contacts, ever.
- **Phase 4 — saved views/segments + the command-centre dashboard** (contacts by stage/source, tasks due).

---

# Session: July 5, 2026
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 4 COMPLETE — smart stage suggestions + close-reason capture shipped. **All four CRM phases are now done.**

## 🎯 Session Summary
The final Phase 4 piece landed: gentle, dismissible stage suggestions driven by the property pipeline, plus reason capture when closing a household as lost. Strictly advisory — a stage NEVER changes without the agent clicking accept. **Naming decision recorded this session: the buyers-agent-facing CRM is called "Monaco".** With this commit, Monaco Phases 1–4 are all complete and live.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`e0d2791` — smart stage suggestions + close-reason capture** (`src/pages/ClientDetail.tsx` + `stage-suggestions-verify.mjs`):
  - **Suggestions (one at a time, purchased outranks offered):** property → *offered* suggests buying stage **Offer Submitted**; property → *purchased* suggests lifecycle **Closed Won** (and moves buying to **Under Contract** when it's below that). Soft rose banner under the stage badges with "Update stage" / "Dismiss". Only shown when genuinely relevant — never for closed/paused households, never proposing a backwards move. Dismissals are session state only (deliberately NOT localStorage — a fresh visit may suggest again).
  - **Accepting reuses the real stage-change path**: `saveStage`'s core was extracted into a shared `changeStage()` (PATCH + entered-at reset + timeline entry) used by both the dialog and the banner — no duplicated logic.
  - **Close-reason capture:** choosing **Closed Lost** in the stage dialog reveals a champagne inset — "Why was this lost? (optional)" with the hint "A reason helps you learn from this — even a few words is enough." Never blocks saving; saves to `lost_reason` and the reason appears in the timeline entry (stored in `event_context.reason`).
  - Verified end-to-end on real data: suggestion appeared instantly after a UI status change, accept round-trips confirmed in the DB (both stages + timeline rows), dismiss/reload behaviour proven, reason saved + rendered on the timeline. Zero WCAG contrast issues across 11 audits desktop + 375px mobile, no h-scroll, tsc clean (0 errors project-wide — the 93 legacy errors are gone). Cleanup confirmed: all six CRM tables 0 rows, `properties` untouched at 15 rows with max updated_at unchanged.

## ⏭️ Remaining Monaco (CRM) work
- **Later phases:** email/calendar integration, unified comms timeline, AI summary + next-best-action (docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md).
- **User-facing documentation + training** (roadmap 📚 section) — a deliverable, not an afterthought.
- **Dani's subscription-gating decision (#23)** — gate point designed, not enforced.
- **Known small follow-up:** no "pause" control exists in the UI yet, so `paused_reason` has no trigger point (the closed-lost reason path is live; a pause action on the client record would complete the pair).

---

# Session: July 4, 2026 (later that day — part 4)
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 4 begun — Saved Views + gentle stage-age "stalling" alerts shipped.

## 🎯 Session Summary
Phase 4 (workflow refinement) is underway with two read-only pieces: preset filter chips over the Clients page and calm nudges for households sitting too long in a stage. No schema changes, no new tables — both features are pure client-side reads over existing data. Both verified end-to-end with seeded real data, zero WCAG contrast issues, and the database left clean (all six CRM tables confirmed 0 rows after each verify run).

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`9935478` — Saved Views filter chips** (`src/pages/Clients.tsx` + `saved-views-verify.mjs`): a chip row above the List/Board toggle — **All / Needs attention / Prospects / Active clients / Closing/closed / Settling** — each with a live count over all clients. Active chip in forest green, inactive quiet ivory. Filters BOTH list and board (cards reduced, columns intact), persists across the view toggle in component state, calm per-view empty states with a "View all clients" escape hatch. "Needs attention" reuses the exact `needsAttention()` rule so counts always match row flags.
- **`af93074` — Stage-age stalling alerts** (`src/lib/stage-age.ts` new + `Clients.tsx`, `ClientDetail.tsx`, `stage-age-verify.mjs`): thresholds in ONE commented constant (`STAGE_AGE_THRESHOLD_DAYS`: new_enquiry 7 / discovery_booked 14 / discovery_completed 10 / engaged 30; closed stages never nudge). Small champagne hourglass chips on list rows and board cards (tooltip "In New Enquiry for 20 days"), a gentle inline nudge on the client record ("…— consider a next step"), and a **"Stalling" saved-view chip**. Key design point: **engaged households are measured by `buying_stage_entered_at`** — a household actively moving through buying stages is never called stalling (proven in the verify: 60-days-engaged client whose buying stage moved 3 days ago shows no nudge). Degrades gracefully on null timestamps.
- **`ede3bb4` — roadmap status refresh** (start of session): CRM_ROADMAP.md header updated to "Phases 1–3 complete"; README already linked the roadmap.

## ⏭️ Next up
- **Phase 4 remaining: lightweight automations & smart defaults** (brief complete → suggest "Brief confirmed"; offer logged → suggest "Offer submitted"; require reason on pause/lost) — see docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md.
- Then the later phases (email/calendar/comms/AI) and the **user-facing documentation + training** (roadmap 📚 section).

---

# Session: July 4, 2026 (later that day — part 3)
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 3 Properties built — **every client-record tab is now real** (no "Soon" placeholders left).

## 🎯 Session Summary
The household property pipeline shipped: a new CRM-owned join table plus the full Properties tab on the Client record. READ-only over the marketplace `properties` table (its 15 rows provably untouched — count + max updated_at identical before/after); writes go only to `client_properties`.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`71a1fa0` — `client_properties` join table** (migration `20260704020000`, applied via Management API and verified): client_id/property_id/agent_id FKs (CASCADE), six-status CHECK, `status_entered_at`, nullable `notes`, UNIQUE (client_id, property_id), 4 indexes, updated_at trigger, **owner-only RLS** (4 policies on `auth.uid() = agent_id`, no view-all — mirrors Phase 1 exactly).
- **`ca429c8` — Properties tab with pipeline** (`src/pages/ClientDetail.tsx` + `properties-tab-verify.mjs`):
  - **Pipeline view** grouped in order: candidate → shortlisted → due_diligence → offered → purchased, with **passed** in a separate collapsible section. Cards: address, title, currency-aware price, beds/baths/parking, clickable status badge, days-in-status, italic note.
  - **Add Property modal**: search real listings by address/street/suburb/city/title (read-only, 8 newest matches), optional "why this property" note; insert defaults to candidate + logs `property_linked`. **Duplicate links blocked twice** — disabled "Linked" chip in the modal + DB unique constraint (409 handled with a friendly message).
  - **Status picker** (same pattern as stage dialogs): PATCH + reset `status_entered_at` + `property_status_changed` {from, to} timeline event, rendered as prose. **Unlink** via frosted confirm + `property_unlinked` event.
  - "Link Property" quick action is live; **no client-record "Soon" placeholders remain** — Overview, Members, Tasks, Brief, Properties, Inspections, Timeline are all real.
  - **Data-shape note:** live property rows store addresses in `street_address` + `city` (`full_address`/`property_address`/`suburb` are null there) — address display and search fall through all of them.
  - Verified end-to-end on real listings (nothing created in `properties`): zero WCAG contrast issues across 10 states desktop + 375px mobile, no h-scroll, all DB checks passed, cleanup confirmed (all 6 CRM tables 0 rows, briefs 4, properties 15 + max updated_at unchanged).

## ⏭️ Next up
- Nice-to-haves (docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md): surface the property pipeline on the board/dashboard; Phase 4 saved views/automations; **user-facing documentation + training** (roadmap 📚 section).

# Session: July 4, 2026 (later that day — part 2)
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 3 begun — read-only Inspections tab on the Client record complete.

## 🎯 Session Summary
Inspections now surface in the CRM. The safe half of Phase 3 shipped: a fully read-only Inspections tab that rides the existing chain (household → linked brief → `inspection_jobs.client_brief_id`) with **no schema changes, no writes to inspection tables, and no existing pages touched**.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`91ce949` — read-only Inspections tab** (`src/pages/ClientDetail.tsx` + `inspections-tab-verify.mjs`):
  - No brief linked → calm "Inspections arrive via the brief" guidance pointing at the Brief tab; brief linked but nothing booked → calm empty state; otherwise a newest-first jobs list: title, quiet-luxury status badge, address, budget (agreed price or range, currency-aware), inspector name when assigned, posted date.
  - **View Job** → existing `/inspections/spotlights/:id`; **View Report** (only when an `inspection_reports` row exists) → existing `/inspections/jobs/:jobId/report/view`. Routes verified against App.tsx.
  - Queries filter `requesting_agent_id = user` (+ the linked brief id). Verified end-to-end with seeded test data twice (once including a real report row to prove the View Report button), zero WCAG contrast issues desktop + 375px mobile, all test data deleted (CRM tables 0, briefs back to 4, jobs back to 9).
- **Two honest incidents, both resolved:** (1) a "contrast issue" turned out to be a screenshot of the wrong page — **pre-existing ProtectedRoute quirk**: on a hard reload it waits max 1s for auth hydration then bounces via `/auth` → `/`; worth a future fix. (2) one verify run failed before its cleanup step, briefly leaving orphan test rows — deleted immediately and all counts re-verified.

## ⏭️ Next up
- **Phase 3 remaining: the properties side** — new `client_properties` join table (migration) + property picker UI + candidate → shortlisted → due diligence → offer → purchased/lost pipeline (docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md).

# Session: July 4, 2026 (later that day)
**Session Focus:** Clients ↔ Briefs linking — **the core of CRM Phase 2 is now done** (dashboard snapshot + FK + linking).

## 🎯 Session Summary
The CRM now connects to briefs. First the safe schema step, then the full linking experience on the Client record — all verified end-to-end through the real UI with test data, then cleaned up.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`8e0bef6` — nullable `client_id` FK added to `client_briefs`** (migration `20260704010000`, applied via Management API): UUID → `clients(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL + partial index `idx_client_briefs_client_id`. Live schema re-verified before AND after (113 → 114 columns); all 4 existing briefs untouched (row count + `max(updated_at)` identical, every `client_id` null).
- **`d017fa2` — full Clients ↔ Briefs linking** (`src/pages/ClientDetail.tsx` + `brief-link-verify.mjs`):
  - "Brief" is now a real tab on the Client record (Properties/Inspections remain "Soon"); the "Open Brief" quick action is live (reads "Link Brief" when unlinked).
  - **Link:** frosted modal listing only this agent's briefs with `client_id` null (a brief can never be poached from another household); PATCH sets `client_id` (filtered by brief id + agent_id) and writes a `brief_linked` timeline event `{brief_id, brief_name}`.
  - **Summary card:** brief name, muted status badge, budget, bed/bath, locations, property types, last updated, must-have chips; "Open Full Brief" → existing `/briefs/:id`.
  - **Unlink:** frosted confirm dialog (never `window.confirm`) clears `client_id` + writes `brief_unlinked`.
  - **Source-of-truth rule (roadmap decision 3):** `household_name` stays the primary display name; the brief's own `client_name` shows only as a footnote and is never modified. The ONLY write the CRM makes to `client_briefs` is set/clear `client_id`; existing briefs pages untouched.
  - Verified with puppeteer (7 audited states, desktop + 375px mobile, zero WCAG contrast issues, no horizontal scroll); DB checks confirmed link → `client_id` = household id + timeline entry, unlink → null + entry. Test household + test brief deleted; CRM tables at 0 rows, `client_briefs` back to its 4 pre-existing rows.

- **Verified (read-only check, no code changed):** the `household_name` source-of-truth rule is honoured everywhere in the CRM (Clients list/board, dashboard snapshot, client record) — no changes needed, that Phase 2 odds-and-end is complete. Also committed the outstanding puppeteer devDependency (`b1e9dc4`).

## ⏭️ Next up
- **CRM Phase 3** (docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md): property + inspection linking into the Client record.

---

# Session: July 4, 2026
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 2 started — dashboard snapshot widgets complete.

## 🎯 Session Summary
First piece of CRM Phase 2 (the safest, read-only piece) built and shipped: a CRM snapshot section on the main dashboard.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`7eaaae0` — CRM snapshot widgets + quick actions on the dashboard** (`src/components/dashboard/CrmSnapshot.tsx`, rendered in `Index.tsx` below StatsGrid, verified via `crm-snapshot-verify.mjs`):
  - Three clickable frosted metric cards (exact StatsGrid styling): **Clients Needing Attention**, **Tasks Due Today**, **Active Households** — all navigate to `/clients`.
  - **Needs-attention preview** (top 3 households + reason, linking to `/clients/:id`) with a calm caught-up empty state; quick actions **View Clients** / **New Client**.
  - Read-only over the CRM tables only (`clients`, `client_tasks`) — raw fetch, `agent_id`-filtered, no briefs tables touched. Gated by `CAN_MANAGE_CLIENT_BRIEFS` (same as the `/clients` routes). "Needing attention" reuses the exact `needsAttention()` rule from Clients.tsx; "due today" uses local-midnight boundaries.
  - Verified empty + seeded states with puppeteer (desktop + 375px mobile, zero WCAG contrast issues, no horizontal scroll); seeded test data deleted, all 5 CRM tables confirmed back to 0 rows. `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` clean.

## ⏭️ Next up
- **Clients ↔ Briefs linking** (CRM Phase 2, docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md): nullable `client_id` FK migration on `client_briefs` (re-verify live schema first), then linking UI + brief summary in the Client record (household-name source-of-truth rule, decision 3).

---

# Session: July 3, 2026 (later that day)
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 1 leftovers — stage controls + Kanban board. **CRM Phase 1 is now fully complete.**

## 🎯 Session Summary
Finished the two Phase 1 leftovers. Both verified with puppeteer (zero WCAG contrast issues, desktop + 375px mobile), tested end-to-end against the live DB, test data deleted afterwards — all 5 CRM tables back to 0 rows.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **`a21318f` — Stage-change controls on the Client record** (`src/pages/ClientDetail.tsx` + `stage-controls-verify.mjs`):
  - Lifecycle + buying stage badges on the summary panel are now clickable → frosted stage-picker modal ("Current" chip, selected check, Update disabled until changed). Buying picker includes "Not started" (clears the stage); a dashed "Set buying stage" control appears when null.
  - On save: raw-fetch PATCH (id + agent_id filtered), resets `stage_entered_at` / `buying_stage_entered_at` so days-in-stage stays accurate, writes `lifecycle_stage_changed` / `buying_stage_changed` timeline activity with `{ from, to }` tokens, refreshes in place (no reload).
  - Timeline renders stage events as prose: "From New Enquiry to Discovery Booked".
- **`9a741a1` — Clients board (Kanban) view** (`src/pages/Clients.tsx` + `board-view-verify.mjs`):
  - List/Board segmented toggle (session state only, no localStorage); on the board a second toggle: "By Relationship" (lifecycle columns) / "By Buying Stage" (buying columns + "Not Started" column for null). Never both at once.
  - Cards: Cormorant household name, members, needs-attention flag, next action + date, and the *other* stage as a subtle badge. Click/Enter opens the record.
  - Native HTML5 drag-and-drop between columns: optimistic move + same PATCH/timestamp/timeline logic as the ClientDetail stage dialogs, toast on success, graceful rollback on failure. Calm dashed empty states.
  - Mobile (375px): board scrolls inside its own container (no page-level scroll), cards tappable; HTML5 drag doesn't fire on touch — change stages from the record page on mobile.
- **Note:** `npx tsc --noEmit` is now fully clean (exit 0) — the "93 pre-existing errors" in older notes no longer exist.

## ⏭️ Next up
- **CRM Phase 2** (docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md): nullable `client_id` FK on `client_briefs`, Clients ↔ Briefs linking + brief summary in the record, CRM dashboard widgets + quick actions.

---

# Session: July 3, 2026
**Session Focus:** CRM Phase 1 built (database + Clients list + Client record)

## 🎯 Session Summary
Planned and built the entire first phase of the CRM (client management system): database, Clients list view with create flow, and the full Client record page. Everything verified with puppeteer screenshots (zero WCAG contrast issues, desktop + 375px mobile) and tested end-to-end through the real UI; all test data deleted afterwards, CRM tables left at 0 rows.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)
- **Planning:** Read the full CRM spec (docs/CRM_DESIGN_SPEC.docx), created `docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md` (phased plan + decisions + risks), added subscription-gating as Dani item #23, referenced roadmap from README (`3114c84`).
- **`46039ff` — CRM Phase 1 database** (migration `20260703010000_create_crm_core_tables.sql`, applied via Management API and verified):
  - 5 tables: `clients` (households, two-layer stages), `client_members` (partial unique index = max one primary contact), `client_tasks` (one model, shared vs member via nullable `client_member_id`), `client_notes`, `client_activities` (append-only timeline, no UPDATE policy).
  - **Owner-only RLS** on every table (`auth.uid() = agent_id`) — 19 policies, zero `USING (true)`.
- **`7b0d002` — Clients list view + New Client form** (`src/pages/Clients.tsx`, `src/pages/ClientForm.tsx`, routes + sidebar nav):
  - List: household name, members summary, lifecycle badge (forest) vs buying badge (rose), next action, last contact, needs-attention flag; calm empty state.
  - Form: household + dynamic members (exactly-one-primary), live-client-needs-next-action validated in the form (never DB). Save chain: client → members → primary pointer → `client_created` timeline entry.
- **`2147eb4` — Client record page** (`src/pages/ClientDetail.tsx` at `/clients/:id`):
  - Summary panel (member chips, both stage badges, next action, quick actions; Open Brief / Link Property / Request Inspection present but disabled "Soon").
  - Tabs: Overview (stage age, open tasks, recent activity), Members (add/edit via frosted modal, primary + decision-maker flags), Tasks (create shared/member tasks, complete/snooze/reschedule), Timeline (newest-first feed). Brief/Properties/Inspections tabs are "Soon" placeholders.
  - All dialogs are custom frosted modals — no `window.confirm` anywhere.
- **Verification:** `clients-verify.mjs` + `client-detail-verify.mjs` — zero contrast issues across 15 audits, no mobile horizontal scroll, full save/interaction chains confirmed in DB. Test households deleted; all 5 CRM tables confirmed back to 0 rows.

## 🔒 Locked decisions (full detail in docs/CRM_ROADMAP.md)
1. Owner field is **`agent_id`** on every CRM table (matches briefs; NOT the spec's assigned_user_id).
2. CRM **reuses `CAN_MANAGE_CLIENT_BRIEFS`** — no new permission.
3. Once a brief links to a household, **`clients.household_name` is source of truth** over `client_briefs.client_name` (Phase 2 rule, recorded now).
4. **Subscription gating is Dani item #23 and NOT yet enforced** — single gate point marked by comment at the CRM routes in App.tsx; tiers deliberately not hard-coded.
5. **Owner-only RLS** — deliberately did NOT copy the briefs "Authenticated users can view all" policy (CRM rows are PII; no agent can see another agent's clients).

## ⏭️ Next up
- Phase 1 leftovers: Kanban board view on Clients page; stage-change controls on the Client record (stages currently display-only).
- Phase 2: add nullable `client_id` FK to `client_briefs`, link Clients ↔ Briefs, brief summary in record, CRM dashboard widgets + quick actions.

# Session: June 29, 2026
**Session Focus:** Post-break reassessment + security remediation (.env exposure fixed, keys rotated)

## 🎯 Session Summary
Returned after a few weeks away. Reassessed true repo state against the 12 June snapshot, then discovered and remediated a security exposure: `.env` was being tracked by git and was live on the public repo.

## ✅ Accomplished
- **Reassessment:** Confirmed repo is on `main`, in sync with origin, builds cleanly (~9s). Confirmed the dashboard-stats work (commit 92c4d6c, 12 June) is genuinely present — StatsGrid uses real raw-fetch queries, not placeholders. NOTE: this commit landed ~11 min after the 12 June docs were written, so earlier docs incorrectly listed dashboard stats as "to do".
- **Security — .env exposure FIXED:**
  - Found `.env` was tracked despite being in .gitignore (it had been committed before the ignore rule, so git kept tracking it). It was present in 7 commits and on public origin/main.
  - Ran `git rm --cached .env` and committed "chore: stop tracking .env (security)" (176afd5) — git no longer tracks it; .gitignore now actually takes effect.
  - **Rotated Supabase secret key** (sb_secret_): created new `edge_functions_service_v2`, updated local .env, deleted old exposed `edge_functions_service`. (Edge functions use a separate auto-injected SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, so nothing live broke.)
  - **Rotated Supabase access token** (sbp_): created "Claude Code Deployment 2026 v2", updated local .env, deleted old "Claude Code Deployment 2026". Three other access tokens were already expired.
  - Confirmed STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env were only "xxx" placeholders — never real, nothing to rotate.

## ⚠️ Carried forward / to check another day
- **Optional:** Restrict Mapbox token by URL (account.mapbox.com) so the public publishable token can't be quota-abused.
- **Optional (cosmetic):** Scrub old secret values from git history (git filter-repo + force-push). Low priority now that keys are rotated and dead.
- **Investigate:** Edge functions reference SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (legacy JWT, per notes disabled 30 May 2026) — confirm functions still authenticate correctly.
- **Investigate:** send-email logged "missing SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS" — confirm whether emails are actually sending.

## 📝 Tooling note
- **Fable 5 is currently unavailable** (Mythos/Fable tier access suspended). Use Opus 4.8 (high effort) in Claude Code for complex tasks instead. Update any prompts that say "Fable 5".

# Session: June 12, 2026
**Session Focus:** Quiet luxury redesign rollout, legacy routing fix, codebase audit, Supabase key migration

## 🎯 Session Summary

Major design and infrastructure day — 14 commits. The quiet-luxury aesthetic now covers the entire app, a product-breaking routing bug was fixed, and a full codebase audit was produced.

## ✅ Accomplished (with commits)

### Design — Quiet Luxury Rollout
- `0e6c1a4` Premium dashboard redesign (hero aurora, frosted stat cards, forest sidebar, ivory top bar)
- `336627c` Deeper glassmorphism: stronger aurora, warm glow shadows, sidebar/page gradients
- `b845428` Sidebar depth gradient fixed (was rendering but imperceptible), card luxury feel; added `sidebar-probe.mjs` diagnostic
- `29b53bb` Dashboard polish + full mobile responsiveness at 375px (44px touch targets, drawer, bottom nav palette fix)
- `032a400` Stats numbers reverted to DM Sans (Cormorant breaks multi-digit figures — "12" read as "I 2")
- `2584b0b` Detail polish: discreet membership badge, frosted action cards
- `6dea5d3` **Auth page luxury redesign** — split-panel with aurora left panel, ivory form right; all auth logic untouched
- `07f1cd7` Auth tagline globalised ("Where property professionals connect")
- `aae7158` DESIGN VISION section added to CLAUDE.md (palette, typography, non-negotiable rules)
- `5429262` **Quiet luxury palette applied across ALL pages** — index.css token swap (old #064E3B/#C9A84C gold → #2D6350/#B76E79), shared Button default variant fixed (was white-on-gold at 2.2:1 contrast), Landing/Welcome hexes replaced, ~18 contrast failures fixed. Zero contrast issues across landing, forums, messages, marketplace, directory, briefs, pricing, settings + dashboard + auth
- `fece5c5` Forum "Your Activity" panel upgraded to luxury stat card style

### Fixes
- `b5d764e` **Legacy inspection routing fixed** — dashboard buttons were sending users to the dead `inspection_requests` flow; `/inspections` and `/inspections/new` now permanently redirect to the real marketplace (`/inspections/spotlights`, `/inspections/jobs/new`)

### Documentation & Infrastructure
- `7c0fc2e` **Comprehensive codebase audit** → `docs/CODEBASE_AUDIT.md` (41 pages, all components, 30+ tables, TODOs, ranked broken/incomplete items)
- `6f26928` **Supabase key migration documented** — legacy JWT keys disabled by Supabase 30 May 2026; new `sb_secret_` key in gitignored `.env` as `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`; all admin scripts updated to read from env (the old JWT had been hardcoded in committed scripts on the public repo); CLAUDE.md Management API section rewritten

### Verification tooling added this session
`dashboard-verify.mjs`, `auth-verify.mjs`, `palette-verify.mjs`, `sidebar-probe.mjs` — puppeteer login + screenshots + WCAG contrast audits. Run after every visual change.

## 📌 Noted (not done in this session)
- **Work Regions feature** — planned and specced (spec written outside this session). Spec committed end of day and converted to Markdown: `docs/WORK_REGIONS_SPEC.md`. Next session: read the spec, then implement Phase 1A/1B.

## ⚠️ Known issues carried forward (see docs/CODEBASE_AUDIT.md)
- Mock geocoder (Australian cities only) still powers Directory/Marketplace/Inspections filters
- `integrations/supabase/types.ts` stale (3 of ~30 tables); 93 pre-existing `tsc --noEmit` errors
- ~33 `supabase.from()` calls remain (AuthContext, Admin, Marketplace, AddProperty, etc.)
- Review system half-built; dashboard stats hardcoded; Resend email needs API key to activate
- Legacy pages `Inspections.tsx`/`PostInspection.tsx` now unreachable — safe to delete in a cleanup

# Session: January 9, 2026
**Session Focus:** Bug fixes, Client Brief system completion, Profile caching implementation

---

## 🎯 Session Summary

This session focused on fixing critical bugs, completing the Client Brief Creator feature, and resolving persistent profile loading issues in the Agent Hub application.

---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Dashboard Quick Action Buttons Not Working (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Problem:** The three main action buttons on the dashboard (Browse Properties, Request Inspection, Create Brief) did nothing when clicked.

**Root Cause:** Buttons were styled but had no `onClick` handlers or navigation logic.

**Solution:**
- Added `useNavigate` from react-router-dom
- Added `path` property to each tile configuration
- Implemented `onClick={() => navigate(path)}` handlers
- Routes configured:
  - Browse Properties → `/marketplace`
  - Request Inspection → `/inspections`
  - Create Brief → `/briefs/new`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/dashboard/PowerTiles.tsx`

---

### 2. **Admin Cannot See "Client Briefs" in Sidebar (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Problem:** Admin users couldn't access Client Briefs feature despite having higher permissions than verified professionals.

**Root Cause:** Sidebar condition was too restrictive: `profile?.role === 'verified_professional'`

**Solution:** Updated condition to include admin role:
```typescript
profile?.role === 'verified_professional' || profile?.role === 'admin'
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx` (line 79)

---

### 3. **Client Briefs Missing Expiry Date and Delete Functionality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### 3A. Expiry Date Feature
**Added:**
- `expiry_date` field (date type) to interface and form
- Date picker input in "Basic Information" section
- Smart expiry badge on brief cards with color coding:
  - **Red:** "Expired" or "Expires today"
  - **Orange:** "Expires tomorrow" or "Expires in 1-7 days"
  - **Amber:** "Expires in 8-30 days"
  - **Gray:** "Expires [date]" (>30 days from now)
- Helper function `getExpiryInfo()` to calculate days until expiry

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/ClientBriefForm.tsx` (interface, initialFormData, form UI, submission)
- `src/pages/ClientBriefs.tsx` (interface, display logic)

#### 3B. Delete Functionality
**Added:**
- Trash icon button on each brief card
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- `handleDelete()` function with error handling
- Toast notifications (success/error)
- Auto-refresh brief list after deletion
- `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent card click when deleting

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/ClientBriefs.tsx`

---

### 4. **Profile Edit Page Blank (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Problem:** Profile Edit page showed nothing - stuck in loading state forever.

**Root Cause:** Profile fetch query was hanging/timing out in the browser but no fallback was implemented.

**Solution:**
- Added 5-second timeout wrapper using `Promise.race()`
- Implemented localStorage caching fallback
- If fetch fails/timeouts, loads profile from `cached_profile` in localStorage
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/settings/ProfileEdit.tsx`

---

### 5. **Client Briefs Sidebar Disappearing (RECURRING ISSUE)**
**Problem:** "Client Briefs" kept disappearing from sidebar, Profile Edit showed blank.

**Root Cause:** Profile data wasn't loading from Supabase due to:
- Network latency issues
- Query hanging in browser
- No caching or fallback mechanism
- React state becoming `null` when fetch failed

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **AuthContext Improvements** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):
   - Added 5-second timeout to profile fetches
   - Implemented localStorage caching (`cached_profile`)
   - On successful fetch: saves to cache
   - On timeout/error: loads from cache
   - Added extensive logging for debugging

2. **Manual Cache Setup:**
   - Created utility script `set-cached-profile.mjs`
   - Generated localStorage command for browser console
   - User executed: `localStorage.setItem('cached_profile', '{...}')`
   - This provided immediate fallback data

3. **ProfileEdit Timeout:**
   - Added same timeout + cache logic to ProfileEdit page
   - Page now loads even if fetch times out

**Result:** App now works reliably even with slow/hanging Supabase queries.

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Supabase Query Hanging in Browser
**Status:** MITIGATED (not fully resolved)

**Symptoms:**
- Profile queries hang/timeout in browser
- Backend queries work fine (tested with Node.js scripts)
- Only affects frontend browser environment

**Potential Causes:**
- Browser extension blocking requests
- CORS issue
- Network firewall
- Antivirus software
- Supabase cold start latency

**Current Workaround:**
- 5-second timeout on all profile queries
- localStorage caching for immediate fallback
- Works reliably even when queries hang

**Future Investigation:**
- Check browser extensions (ad blockers, privacy tools)
- Test in different browsers
- Check network/firewall settings
- Consider moving to closer Supabase region

### Issue 2: Multiple Profile Fetches on Page Load
**Status:** MINOR (doesn't break functionality)

**Observation:**
- Auth system fires multiple profile fetches during initialization
- Some timeout, others succeed
- Eventually data loads correctly

**Cause:**
- React StrictMode triggering double renders
- Multiple auth state change events
- Both onAuthStateChange and getSession() fire

**Impact:**
- Slightly slower initial load
- Unnecessary API calls
- No functional issues

**Potential Fix:**
- Debounce profile fetch calls
- Deduplicate auth state listeners
- Optimize auth initialization flow
